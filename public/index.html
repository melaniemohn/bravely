					<li>When a stressful moment comes up, employees can use the Bravely app to describe their situation, and get matched with the right Pro for their issue.</li>
					<li>Conversations take place over the phone, last around 45 minutes, and are driven by proven conflict management and crucial conversation frameworks.</li>
					<li>After speaking with their Pro, employees are ready for the next step: a productive conversation with their boss, colleagues, direct reports, or HR teams.</li>
