Github suggested calling this repository "automatic-guacamole," which is an amazing idea, but not a particularly descriptive name.

Here's my attempt at building out the front-end of Bravely's marketing site.

## A few quick notes:
- As an alternative to Bravely's fancier fonts, I'm using slightly smaller versions of Montserrat and Futura.
- The hamburger menu (which replaces the left icon in the mobile version of the navbar) is a little hacked together, and I haven't made it interactive yet (let me know if I should!)
- I spent a little time trying to figure out how to do parallax scrolling from scratch, but I wound up finding a jQuery plugin that makes it nice and simple. Phew.
